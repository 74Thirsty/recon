# Recon by C. Hirschauer

**Recon** is an interactive, terminal-based recon tool designed to streamline network exploration. Whether you're performing Nmap scans, capturing packets with Wireshark, or validating IP addresses, **Recon** is your go-to companion for every phase of your reconnaissance process. Built with simplicity and efficiency in mind, this script runs seamlessly on both Linux and macOS.

## Features

- **Nmap Scan**: Conduct comprehensive scans to discover open ports and services on a target IP.
- **Wireshark Packet Capture**: Capture real-time network traffic from a specified IP and port.
- **IP Validation**: Validate whether an inputted IP address is properly formatted.
- **Tool Installation**: Automatically checks for and installs necessary tools (`nmap`, `wireshark`, `figlet`) if they're not already present.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure your system is equipped with the required tools. **Recon** checks and installs these automatically, but hereâ€™s a quick manual guide for setting up:

1. **Linux**:
    - Install `nmap`: `sudo apt-get install -y nmap` (or `sudo yum install -y nmap` for RPM-based systems)
    - Install `wireshark`: `sudo apt-get install -y tshark`
    - Install `figlet`: `sudo apt-get install -y figlet`
  
2. **macOS**:
    - Install `nmap`: `brew install nmap`
    - Install `wireshark`: `brew install wireshark`
    - Install `figlet`: `brew install figlet`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/74Thirsty/recon.git
    cd recon
    ```

2. **Make the script executable**:

    ```bash
    chmod +x recon.sh
    ```

3. **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    ./recon.sh
    ```

## Usage

When you run the script, it will check for the required tools (`nmap`, `wireshark`, `figlet`). If any of these are missing, it will attempt to install them for you.

Upon startup, **Recon** will display a badass ASCII banner:

```bash
===============================
RECON by C. Hirschauer
===============================
````

Then, you'll be presented with an interactive menu:

```bash
===========================
  Interactive Recon Script
===========================
1) Nmap Scan
2) Wireshark Packet Capture
3) Validate IP Address
4) Exit
===========================
Choose an option: 
```

Select an option by entering the corresponding number:

1. **Nmap Scan**: Enter a target IP, and **Recon** will run an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services.
2. **Wireshark Packet Capture**: Enter a target IP and port to begin capturing packets. Type `stop` to end the capture and save the results as a `.pcap` file.
3. **Validate IP Address**: Validate any IP address to check if it follows the correct format.
4. **Exit**: Exit the script gracefully.

## Example

```bash
===============================
RECON by C. Hirschauer
===============================

===========================
  Interactive Recon Script
===========================
1) Nmap Scan
2) Wireshark Packet Capture
3) Validate IP Address
4) Exit
===========================
Choose an option: 1
Enter the target IP address to scan:
192.168.1.1
Running Nmap scan on 192.168.1.1...
Nmap scan completed. Results saved in nmap_scan_192.168.1.1.txt
```
